# 1. slam2d
* scan match
* correspondence
* map update


## 1.1 scan match
ICP/PLICP method is used for scan match estimation, and ceres is used as the nonlinear solve with point to line contraints.

## 1.2 correspondence
KNN method of pcl lib is used to find point correspondence

## 1.3 map update
OpenCV function line and circle is used to update grid map.
